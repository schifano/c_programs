c_programs
======

A repository devoted to collecting my C programs.

1. array_ints - Program that retrieves ten integers from the keyboard, prints them out in reverse order to the console and writes them to a text file.

2. malloc - An example of dynamically allocating memory in C.

3. my_cat - A program that replicates the functionality of the Linux command "cat" by storing arguments from the command line and reading files. If cat is executed normally without file specification, it will process the standard input such as echo text back to the user.

4. open_write - Example C programs where one opens a file and the other writes to a file.


5. stack - A basic stack data structure.

6. tokenizer - Program that counts the number of words and number of lines in a text file.
